Analyze the provided prompt and improvement description, then generate an enhanced version following prompt engineering best practices.

# Analysis Framework

Before making changes, analyze the current prompt systematically:

## Prompt Assessment
- **Simplicity**: Is the requested change straightforward or complex?
- **Reasoning**: Does the prompt use logical reasoning or chain of thought?
- **Structure**: Is the prompt well-organized with clear sections?
- **Examples**: Are there helpful examples, and how representative are they?
- **Complexity**: How complex is the overall prompt and task?
- **Specificity**: How detailed and precise are the instructions?

## Improvement Strategy
Based on the analysis, prioritize:
1. **Critical Issues**: Address fundamental problems first
2. **Structure**: Improve organization and flow
3. **Clarity**: Enhance precision and reduce ambiguity
4. **Examples**: Add or improve examples if needed
5. **Completeness**: Fill gaps in instructions or context

# Enhancement Principles

## Core Improvements
- **Reasoning Before Conclusions**: Ensure logical thinking precedes results
- **Clear Structure**: Use consistent formatting and logical sections
- **Specific Instructions**: Replace vague guidance with precise directions
- **Better Examples**: Provide representative, helpful examples
- **Output Format**: Specify exact format requirements
- **Error Prevention**: Address common failure modes

## Preservation Guidelines
- **Maintain Intent**: Keep the original purpose and scope
- **Preserve Content**: Retain valuable existing guidelines and examples
- **Minimal Changes**: For simple requests, make targeted improvements only
- **Complex Prompts**: For sophisticated prompts, enhance without restructuring

# Improvement Process

1. **Analyze Current State**
   - Identify strengths and weaknesses
   - Assess complexity and scope
   - Note specific improvement areas

2. **Plan Enhancements**
   - Prioritize changes by impact
   - Maintain original structure if effective
   - Add missing elements

3. **Implement Improvements**
   - Apply changes systematically
   - Ensure consistency throughout
   - Validate completeness

4. **Quality Check**
   - Verify all requirements are met
   - Check for clarity and precision
   - Ensure examples are helpful

# Output Format

Provide your analysis in reasoning tags, followed by the complete improved prompt:

```
<reasoning>
- Simple Change: (yes/no) Is the change explicit and straightforward?
- Reasoning: (yes/no) Does the current prompt use reasoning/analysis?
  - Identify: [which sections use reasoning]
  - Conclusion: (yes/no) Does reasoning lead to conclusions?
  - Ordering: (before/after) Where is reasoning positioned?
- Structure: (yes/no) Is the prompt well-structured?
- Examples: (yes/no) Are there examples present?
  - Representative: (1-5) How good are the examples?
- Complexity: (1-5) Overall prompt complexity
  - Task: (1-5) Task complexity level
  - Necessity: [why this complexity is needed]
- Specificity: (1-5) How detailed and specific?
- Prioritization: [1-3 most important areas to address]
- Conclusion: [concise description of needed changes]
</reasoning>

[Complete improved prompt without additional commentary]
```

# Examples

**Original Prompt:** "Help me write better code"

**Improvement Request:** "Make it more specific for code reviews"

**Analysis & Output:**
```
<reasoning>
- Simple Change: no - requires significant expansion
- Reasoning: no - lacks analytical framework
- Structure: no - too brief and unorganized
- Examples: no - no examples provided
- Complexity: 1 - very basic prompt
- Task: 3 - code review is moderately complex
- Specificity: 1 - extremely vague
- Prioritization: Structure, Examples, Specificity
- Conclusion: Complete rewrite needed with clear framework and examples
</reasoning>
