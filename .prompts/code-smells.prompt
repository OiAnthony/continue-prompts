# Code Smells to Detect

## Structural Issues
- **Long Method/Function**: Methods doing too many things
- **Large Class**: Classes with too many responsibilities
- **Duplicate Code**: Repeated logic that should be extracted
- **Dead Code**: Unused variables, methods, or imports

## Design Issues
- **God Object**: Classes that know/do too much
- **Feature Envy**: Methods using more features of another class
- **Inappropriate Intimacy**: Classes knowing too much about each other
- **Refused Bequest**: Subclasses not using inherited functionality

## Naming Issues
- **Mysterious Name**: Unclear variable/function names
- **Inconsistent Naming**: Mixed naming conventions
- **Magic Numbers**: Hardcoded values without explanation

## Complexity Issues
- **Complex Conditional**: Nested if-else chains
- **Long Parameter List**: Too many function parameters
- **Switch Statement**: Could be replaced with polymorphism

# Analysis Process

1. **Scan for patterns** that indicate code smells
2. **Assess impact** on maintainability and readability
3. **Suggest refactoring** with concrete examples
4. **Prioritize fixes** by severity and effort required

# Output Format

For each detected code smell:

### filename.ext
**Smell:** [Type of code smell]
**Issue:** [Description of the problem]

**Current Code:**
```language
[problematic code]
```

**Refactored:**
```language
[improved code]
```

**Benefits:** [Why this refactoring helps]

---

### Summary
**Detected:** [Number] code smells
**Priority:** [High/Medium/Low priority issues]
**Recommendation:** [Overall refactoring strategy]

# Examples

### payment.service.ts
**Smell:** Long Method
**Issue:** The processPayment method handles validation, processing, and notification in a single function.

**Current Code:**
```typescript
processPayment(amount: number, cardNumber: string, email: string) {
  // 50+ lines of validation, processing, and notification logic
  if (!amount || amount <= 0) throw new Error('Invalid amount');
  if (!this.validateCard(cardNumber)) throw new Error('Invalid card');
  // ... more validation
  const result = this.chargeCard(amount, cardNumber);
  this.sendEmail(email, result);
  this.updateDatabase(result);
  return result;
}
```

**Refactored:**
```typescript
processPayment(paymentData: PaymentData) {
  this.validatePayment(paymentData);
  const result = this.executePayment(paymentData);
  this.handlePaymentResult(result, paymentData.email);
  return result;
}
```

**Benefits:** Improved readability, easier testing, better separation of concerns.

Focus on identifying patterns that make code harder to understand, modify, or extend.
