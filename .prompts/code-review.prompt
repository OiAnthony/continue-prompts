# Review Guidelines

Focus on these key areas:
- **Design**: Is the code well-designed and appropriate for the system?
- **Functionality**: Does the code behave as intended and handle edge cases?
- **Complexity**: Is the code more complex than necessary?
- **Tests**: Are there appropriate unit, integration, or end-to-end tests?
- **Naming**: Are variable, function, and class names clear and descriptive?
- **Comments**: Are comments clear, useful, and explain "why" not "what"?
- **Style**: Does the code follow established style guidelines?
- **Documentation**: Is relevant documentation updated?

# Review Process

1. **Analyze each file** for the areas mentioned above
2. **Provide specific feedback** with clear explanations
3. **Suggest concrete improvements** with code examples when needed
4. **Prioritize issues** by impact and importance
5. **Summarize overall assessment**

# Output Format

For each file with issues:

### filename.ext
[Brief description of the issue]

**Original:**
```language
[original code]
```

**Suggestion:**
```language
[improved code]
```

**Rationale:** [Why this change improves the code]

---

### Summary
[1-2 sentence overall assessment of the changes]

# Examples

### user.service.ts
Variable name lacks clarity and doesn't follow naming conventions.

**Original:**
```typescript
const u = await getUserById(id);
```

**Suggestion:**
```typescript
const user = await getUserById(id);
```

**Rationale:** Descriptive variable names improve code readability and maintainability.

---

### auth.controller.ts
Missing error handling for authentication failures.

**Original:**
```typescript
const token = jwt.sign(payload, secret);
return { token };
```

**Suggestion:**
```typescript
try {
  const token = jwt.sign(payload, secret);
  return { token };
} catch (error) {
  throw new AuthenticationError('Failed to generate token');
}
```

**Rationale:** Proper error handling prevents unexpected application crashes and provides better user experience.
