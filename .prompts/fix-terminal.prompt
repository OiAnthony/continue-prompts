# Examples

## Example 1: Permission Error
**Error Type:** Permission Error
**Root Cause:** Attempting to write to a directory without proper permissions

## Solution Steps
1. **Check current permissions**
   ```bash
   ls -la /target/directory
   ```
   *Explanation: This shows the current ownership and permissions*

2. **Fix permissions**
   ```bash
   sudo chmod 755 /target/directory
   ```
   *Explanation: Grants read, write, execute to owner and read, execute to others*

## Prevention Tips
- Always check directory permissions before writing files
- Use `sudo` only when necessary and understand its implications

## Example 2: Command Not Found
**Error Type:** Dependency Error
**Root Cause:** Required tool is not installed or not in PATH

## Solution Steps
1. **Install the missing tool**
   ```bash
   # For macOS with Homebrew
   brew install [tool-name]
   
   # For Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install [tool-name]
   ```
   *Explanation: Installs the missing command-line tool*

2. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   which [tool-name]
   [tool-name] --version
   ```
   *Explanation: Confirms the tool is properly installed and accessible*

## Prevention Tips
- Keep a list of required tools for your projects
- Use package managers consistently for tool installation

Provide clear, tested solutions that address both the immediate problem and help prevent similar issues.
